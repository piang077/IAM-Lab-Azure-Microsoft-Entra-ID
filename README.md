# IAM-Lab-Azure-Microsoft-Entra-ID
# Overview

This lab demonstrates cloud-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) using Microsoft Entra ID. The goal is to configure, test, and secure user identities and access controls in a modern enterprise environment. All tasks follow best practices for account management, authentication, and access security.

**The lab focuses on**

- Creating and managing users and groups

- Implementing password policies and MFA

- Enabling Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)

- Configuring Conditional Access policies

- Testing access scenarios and auditing activity

The lab was conducted in a cloud trial environment, providing hands-on experience with modern IAM features without the need for on-premises infrastructure. Prior hands-on experience with Active Directory provided foundational knowledge of user and group management, which was applied in this cloud-based IAM lab.

**Lab Tasks**

**1. User and Group Management**

- Created test users and groups in Entra ID

- Assigned appropriate roles and permissions

- Verified user login and access

**2. Password Policies**

- Configured password complexity and expiration policies

- Tested policy enforcement with sample users

**3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

- Enabled MFA for selected users

- Tested MFA login flow

- Documented challenges and outcomes

**4. Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)**

- Enabled SSPR for all users

- Tested reset workflow and email/phone verification

- Ensured secure configuration

**5. Conditional Access**

- Created policies to enforce MFA based on location, device, or group

- Tested policy impact on different users

- Documented any exceptions or issues

**6. Auditing and Access Testing**

- Reviewed sign-in logs for suspicious activity

- Checked policy compliance for users and groups

- Documented results and recommended improvements

# Outcome

- Applied hands-on cloud IAM skills relevant to modern enterprise security

- Demonstrated user management, policy configuration, and secure access practices

- Produced well-documented methodology and screenshots suitable for professional review
